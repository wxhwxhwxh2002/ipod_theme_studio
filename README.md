# iPod Theme Studio

A GUI-focused fork of [nfzerox/ipod_theme](https://github.com/nfzerox/ipod_theme) for editing and repacking iPod nano themes with a more approachable desktop workflow.

简体中文说明: [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)

This project still builds on the original `ipod_theme` work, which itself is based on [ipod_sun](https://github.com/CUB3D/ipod_sun), [ipodhax](https://github.com/760ceb3b9c0ba4872cadf3ce35a7a494/ipodhax), and [silverutil](https://github.com/spotlightishere/silverutil).

Be sure to check out community forks and projects with additional features. [asset replacer](https://assetreplacer.zeehondie.net/) lets you create themes with a graphical interface right from your browser. And thanks to [TGRgitx](https://github.com/TGRgitx)'s generous contributions, this repo now includes enhancements from [ipod_theme_max_features](https://github.com/TISgitx/ipod_theme_max_features), which adds support for customizing sounds, modifying localization text for additional languages, and untethered boot for iPod nano 7th generation so you don't have to manually restart from disk mode.

You can find pre-made themes from [NanoLib](http://nanolib.net) and [NanoVault](https://github.com/g0lder/NanoVault), join [iPod nano 6/7 Themes discord server](https://discord.gg/SfWYYPUAEZ) to share and download even more pre-made themes, and [iPod nano hacking discord server](https://discord.gg/7PnGEXjW3X) for hacking iPod nano, then share your themes and setup with [r/ipod](https://www.reddit.com/r/ipod/)!

## This Fork

This fork repositions the project as `iPod Theme Studio`: a friendlier desktop-oriented layer on top of the original `ipod_theme` workflow, while keeping the upstream command-line process intact.

- Chinese README for this fork: [README.zh-CN.md](README.zh-CN.md)
- Original upstream project: [nfzerox/ipod_theme](https://github.com/nfzerox/ipod_theme)
- License remains GPL-3.0, following the upstream project

### Added work in this fork

- Added `theme_studio.py`, a desktop GUI for browsing, previewing, replacing, and repacking artwork
- Added `theme_studio_core.py`, which wraps the unpack/replace/repack workflow for official firmware and community IPSW files
- Added source launch helpers for desktop use, including `run_theme_studio.bat` on Windows and `run_theme_studio.command` on macOS
- Added a portable bundle workflow through `build_portable_bundle.bat`, so Windows users can ship a no-install folder with a bundled Python runtime
- Added artwork preview improvements, Nano 7 quick grouping shortcuts, and basic capacity-risk reminders for assets promoted to `_1888`
- Added built-in crop / resize flow for oversized images, with higher-quality downscaling for wallpaper replacement
- Added manual color-conversion preview and strategy selection across `0004` / `0008` / `0064` / `0065` / `0565` / `1888` artwork workflows
- Added a saved artwork library with search, notes, delete, import-from-computer, reuse-in-replacement, and manual color-conversion tools
- Added batch import into the saved artwork library, with optional shared target size and per-image crop flow
- Added direct format detection for saved assets, so imported images and manually converted library entries show an inferred format even when the filename does not contain an artwork suffix
- Added a font-slot manager for firmware `/Resources/Fonts`, with staged `.ttf` replacement, export, and build-time writeback
- Added a targeted TTC workflow for `STHeiti-Medium.ttc / Heiti SC`, so the Simplified Chinese font member can be replaced without replacing the whole collection
- Added an About page in the GUI with upstream attribution and GPL-3.0 notice
- Improved Windows Python handling in `src/main.rs` so unpacking is more reliable when using a venv or conda environment
- Documented the missing Python dependency `fs`

### Current GUI scope

The current GUI is focused on artwork workflows:

- Device selection: nano 6, nano 7 (2012), nano 7 (2015)
- Import official firmware or a community IPSW
- Unpack and preview artwork
- Replace artwork with automatic size checks
- Built-in crop / resize for large source images, so common wallpaper prep can be done inside the GUI
- Auto-promote some palette-based assets to `_1888.png` when the replacement image exceeds the original color limit
- Keep the original low-color format automatically when a replacement already satisfies it, and only ask when promotion or manual conversion is actually needed
- Preview manual color-conversion results with different strategies before committing
- Save current artwork into a reusable local library
- Import outside images into the saved library, either as-is or after cropping / resizing
- Batch-import multiple outside images into the saved library, either directly or with one shared target size plus per-image cropping
- Search the saved library by filename or note, edit notes, delete saved items, and reuse saved assets as replacement sources
- Manually convert the current artwork or saved-library assets to lower-color formats
- Browse firmware font slots, export the current font file, and stage `.ttf` replacements that are written during the final IPSW build
- Show `.ttc` / `.otf` font slots as read-only entries so unsupported formats are visible without being silently skipped
- Replace the `Heiti SC` member inside `STHeiti-Medium.ttc` as a dedicated Chinese-font workflow, while leaving the other TTC members untouched
- Repack a modified IPSW for flashing through iTunes / Apple Devices

### Portable bundle

This fork now also supports a Windows-friendly portable distribution model for non-technical users.

- Run `build_portable_bundle.bat` to create a self-contained folder at `portable_bundle/iPodThemeStudio_Portable`
- Before running `build_portable_bundle.bat`, activate the Python environment you want to bundle, or set `IPOD_THEME_RUNTIME_SRC` to that runtime root
- The generated folder bundles a local Python runtime plus the GUI app and its required templates
- End users can launch the tool by double-clicking `launch_theme_studio_portable.bat`
- The GUI workflow in this portable bundle does not require Rust, Cargo, or `arm-none-eabi-gcc`

The bundle itself is intended for release archives or cloud-drive sharing and is not committed into the repo.

For macOS, the recommended path is still to run from source inside a prepared Python/conda environment. A true drag-and-drop portable app bundle is not included yet.

The original CLI tutorial below is still the authoritative upstream workflow and remains available as-is.

### Latest updates

### 03/08/2026
•MacOS Hotfix(Language packing issues) 

#### 02/01/2026:
•Windows native support 

### Upgrading from an older version

#### Update from the version of 01/16/2026:
Just download the archive again and copy all the files to your folder (with replacement)

#### Update from older versions:
The same steps as for the update of 01/16/2026, but before that, if you made themes for nano 7, you need to delete all *.MSE files in the root of the folder(Only in the root of the folder, in other places, MSE will be replaced automatically, the firmware will also be downloaded again, but your theme patches will also be applied again)

### Tutorial

Before using `ipod_theme`, you need to install some dependencies first.

[0] If you are on Windows, you need to install some programs:
    [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Version 3.11.x is recommended, latest has problems with installing many things), 
    [Rust](https://win.rustup.rs) (When asked to proceed with standard installation, just press enter),    
    [arm-none-eabi-gcc](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads) (You need to select the "AArch32 bare-metal target (arm-none-eabi)" MSI file in the sections "Windows (mingw-w64-i686), hosted cross toolchains" for 32-bit and "Windows (mingw-w64-x86_64), hosted cross toolchains" for 64-bit systems)

[1] If you are running macOS or Linux, launch the Terminal app. 
   On Windows, press Win+R and type cmd
    
[2] Only if you're running macOS, install Homebrew and add it to the PATH environment:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
echo >> ~/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

[3] Only if you're running macOS, install `arm-none-eabi-gcc`:If you are on Windows, you need to do some steps and before that

```shell
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

[4] Only if you're running Linux, install `xdg-utils`, `unzip`, `pkg-config`, `libssl-dev`, `python3-pip`, and `gcc-arm-none-eabi`:

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt install xdg-utils unzip pkg-config libssl-dev python3-pip gcc-arm-none-eabi -y
```

[5] Only if you are running macOS or Linux install Rust this way. When asked to proceed with standard installation, just press enter:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

[6] Only if you are running macOS or Linux, add Rust to the PATH environment.

```shell
. "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

[7] Install `fs`, `pyfatfs`, `fonttools`, and `pillow`:

For MacOS and Linux:

```shell
export PIP_BREAK_SYSTEM_PACKAGES=1 && pip3 install fs pyfatfs fonttools pillow numpy opencv-python-headless
```

For macOS users, a simple setup path is:

1. Install Homebrew if needed:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Install Python 3.11:

```shell
brew install python@3.11
```

3. Install the GUI dependencies:

```shell
python3 -m pip install fs pyfatfs fonttools pillow numpy opencv-python-headless
```

4. Launch the GUI:

```shell
python3 theme_studio.py
```

On macOS you can also double-click `run_theme_studio.command` after preparing Python and the dependencies. On Windows, use `run_theme_studio.bat`.

If `run_theme_studio.command` does not launch because of missing execute permission, run:

```shell
chmod +x run_theme_studio.command
./run_theme_studio.command
```

If macOS still blocks it after copying or downloading the repo, run:

```shell
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine run_theme_studio.command
```

For Windows, execute and close terminal:
```shell
pip3 install fs pyfatfs fonttools pillow numpy opencv-python-headless
```

If you prefer conda, keep it in one place:

```shell
conda create -n ipod_theme python=3.11 -y
conda activate ipod_theme
python -m pip install fs pyfatfs fonttools pillow numpy opencv-python-headless
python theme_studio.py
```

#### 1) Download and unpack iPod firmware:

- Download and unzip `ipod_theme`, then cd into unzipped path:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/Downloads && cd ~/Downloads && curl -L -o ipod_theme-master.zip "https://github.com/nfzerox/ipod_theme/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" && unzip -o ipod_theme-master.zip && cd ipod_theme-master
```

  On Windows:
  Unzip it to the location where you want to store the program, then click on the path line and type cmd

- For iPod nano 7th generation, run:
  
```shell
./01_firmware_unpack_7g
```
  Or just run `01_firmware_unpack_7g.bat` on Windows

- For iPod nano 6th generation, run:

```shell
./01_firmware_unpack_6g
```
  Or just run `01_firmware_unpack_6g.bat` on Windows
   
Make sure you only run the unpack command that matches your iPod model. This automatically downloads the latest firmware, then extracts artwork and translation binaries from it. It will also generate a custom firmware that isn't themed, which you can safely ignore.

#### 2) Unpack and update artwork:

- Unpack the artwork.

```shell
python3 ./02_art_unpack.py
```

On Windows:
```shell
python 02_art_unpack.py
```

- For macOS or Linux, open the `body` folder with:

```shell
open ./body
```

- For Windows, open the `body` folder with explorer

This opens the unpacked `body` folder, which contains all artwork including icons, wallpapers, clock faces, and more.

When replacing any artwork, your new artwork must exactly match the resolution and color format of the original. The color format is specified in the suffix of the artwork:

- `*_0004.png`: 4-bit greyscale
- `*_0008.png`: 8-bit greyscale
- `*_0064.png`: No more than 255 colors
- `*_0065.png`: No more than 65545 colors
- `*_0565.png`: RGB565
- `*_1888.png`: Any RGB with alpha

If the original artwork doesn't end with `_1888.png`, and your new artwork contains a larger number of total colors than the original, you must use Indexed Color in Photoshop to reduce the total number of colors. After reducing the total number of colors with Photoshop, open and re-save the processed artwork using Preview (Mac) or Paint (Windows).

If you don't have Photoshop or don't want to reduce the total number of colors, you can also delete the original artwork, then save yours as `*********_1888.png`. For example, delete `229442246_0065.png` and save yours as `229442246_1888.png`.

Don't replace too many non `*_1888.png` artwork with `*_1888.png`, as this will exceed the rsrc partition size limit and cause custom firmware repack to fail in step 7. To save space, only replace artwork that matches your iPod color. Never delete artwork without making a replacement.

After replacing icons, replace the tapdown shape mask. It is the artwork right before the first icon.

Advanced Tip: If you need to figure out which file an artwork corresponds to, you can generate a full replacement set with reference labels on solid fill using `python3 ./02_art_z_generate_reference_labels_only.py`. Take caution as this will override all existing artwork.

#### 3) Repack updated artwork:

```shell
python3 ./03_art_pack.py
```

On Windows:
```shell
python ./03_art_pack.py
```

This packs your custom artwork into `SilverImagesDB.LE.bin2`, which automatically gets used in step 7.

If it fails, the failing artwork is the one after the last successful artwork. Check the format of your new artwork, and make sure it exactly matches the original, then repeat this step.

If you want to remove all custom artwork and start over, repeat step 2.

#### 4) Unpack and repack translations (optional):

```shell
./04_optional_strings_unpack
```
  Or just run `04_optional_strings_unpack.bat` on Windows 

This will open a huge list of choices where you can select either all languages or just certain ones, after which the languages will be unpacked along the path `path/to/ipod_theme/Languages/SilverDB."lang".LE`. Open this directory and find the `Str .yaml` file there and open it in your favorite text editor (or one that supports yaml files). You may edit values after `!String ` as you see fit. Unless you're trying to hide a label, the space character between `!String` and the translation is required.

To change app labels on the Home Screen, use Command+F to find the second instance of `Music`. This is where app label translations begin. You can change or delete `Music` from the line, and repeat the same for other app names.

The `iTunes U` app is hidden from iPod by default unless you've synced an iTunes U lecture from iTunes. The label for `iTunes U` is not translated and cannot be hidden.

Once you're done, save your changes and run:

```shell
./05_optional_strings_pack
```
  Or just run `05_optional_strings_pack.bat` on Windows 

This will show a list of your unpacked languages, you can select all or just some, after that this script packs your custom translations into `SilverDB."lang".LE.bin2` packs, which automatically gets used in step 6.

#### 5) Apply custom font (optional):

Find your favorite font on [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), then click Get Font > Download all. Unzip your download, then drill into the `static` folder.

Rename the font that ends in `-Regular.ttf` into `Helvetica.ttf`. Rename the font that ends in `-Bold.ttf` into `HelveticaBold.ttf`.

- For macOS or Linux, open the `Fonts` folder with:

```shell
open ./Fonts
```

- For Windows, open the `Fonts` folder with explorer

Copy `Helvetica.ttf` and `HelveticaBold.ttf` into the `Fonts` folder.

Tip: Not all fonts are compatible with iPod nano. If your iPod fails to boot after applying a custom font, try a different font, or remove your custom fonts from the `Fonts` folder.

#### 6) Replacing sounds (optional):
When unpacking, a `Sounds` folder should appear in the folder. Open it and look through all the sounds. To replace a specific sound, select any sound you want to replace (it must match the extension of the original file, if it doesn't match, convert it) and add the `.new` extension to the file, after which the sound will be automatically used during packing

Don't replace too many sounds in very good quality or longer than the original as this will exceed the rsrc partition size limit and cause custom firmware repack to fail in step 7.

#### 7) Repack iPod firmware:

- For iPod nano 7th generation, run:

```shell
./06_firmware_pack_7g
```
  Or just run `06_firmware_pack_7g.bat` on Windows 
  
- For iPod nano 6th generation, run:

```shell
./06_firmware_pack_6g
```
  Or just run `06_firmware_pack_6g.bat` on Windows 
  
This repacks your artwork and translations into a new custom firmware with swapped osos and rsrc.

If you see any error in purple or pink, the firmware repack has failed. Even if Terminal shows "Successfully zipped the directory", the resulting firmware is likely corrupted and should never be used.

If you see `pyfatfs._exceptions.PyFATException: Not enough free space to allocate ******** bytes (******** bytes free)`, it means the repack failed because your replacement artwork (or sounds) is too large. You can subtract those two numbers and divide it by 1000 to determine how many KB of extra artwork(or sounds) to shave off. Then repeat step 2-3, but with fewer artwork replacements, or with reduced number of colors using Indexed Color with Photoshop, or with reduced quality of sounds using converters(any converter), then try step 7 again.

For iPod nano 7th generation (2012), the repacked firmware is called `iPod_1.1.2_39A10023_2012_repack.ipsw`. For iPod nano 7th generation (2015), the repacked firmware is called `iPod_1.1.2_39A10023_2015_repack.ipsw`.

For iPod nano 6th generation, the repacked firmware is called `iPod_1.2_36B10147_repack.ipsw`.

- For macOS or Linux, open the folder that contains the repacked firmware with:

```shell
open .
```

- For Windows, open the folder that contains the repacked firmware with explorer

#### 8) Flash custom firmware:

Connect your iPod to your computer. Before flashing custom firmware, back up your iPod. On macOS or Linux, double click the iPod icon on your Desktop to open it as a disk. On Windows, open File Explorer and double click your iPod.

On macOS, press `Command`+`Shift`+`.` to show hidden files. On Linux, press `Ctrl`+`H` (command may differ depending on distro) to show hidden files. On Windows, use View > Show > Hidden items to show hidden files. Make sure you can see the hidden `iPod_Control` folder which contains all your media, then copy everything from your iPod to a new folder on your computer.

For Windows:

1. Install and open iTunes.
2. Connect your iPod nano and wait for iTunes to detect it.
3. Click the small iPod device icon near the upper-left area of the iTunes window to open the device summary page.
4. Find the `Check for Update` button.
5. Hold the `Shift` key and click `Check for Update`.
6. Choose the repacked custom `.ipsw` firmware from step 7.
7. Confirm the update and wait for iTunes to finish.

For macOS:

1. Connect your iPod nano.
2. Open Finder and select your iPod in the sidebar.
3. Find the `Check for Update` button on the device page.
4. Hold the `Option` key and click `Check for Update`.
5. Choose the repacked custom `.ipsw` firmware from step 7.
6. Confirm the update and wait for Finder to finish.

If you are running Linux, use a Windows virtual machine and connect your iPod to the virtual machine. In normal cases, prefer `Check for Update` instead of `Restore iPod`.

After your iPod finishes updating, you should see your custom artwork. To see your custom translations or hidden app labels, open Settings > General > Language > Select any language you have edited > Save.

Note: When running custom themed firmware, iPod nano 6th generation may forget song ratings, playlist edits, or changed settings after reboot. To work around this, perform step 10, make your changes, then step 8 again. This doesn't affect iPod nano 7th generation.

#### 9) If your iPod shows "OK to disconnect" in black and white(Only relevant for iPod nano 6 owners):
If you restart your iPod, or if your iPod battery dies, it will boot into disk mode, showing "OK to disconnect" in black and white. This is expected for custom iPod nano firmware, because it relies on swapping regular OS and disk mode to work.

For iPod nano 7th generation:

- The problem is not relevant due to the new exploit

For iPod nano 6th generation:

- Press and hold both the volume down button and the power button until you see the Apple logo.
- Once you see the Apple logo, immediately release the power button.
- Then immediately press and hold both volume down and volume up buttons, until your see the Home Screen.

#### 10) Go back to stock firmware:
You can go back to stock firmware while preserving data. First download the stock firmware for your iPod:

- [iPod nano 7th generation (2015)](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/ipod/sbml/osx/bundles/031-59796-20160525-8E6A5D46-21FF-11E6-89D1-C5D3662719FC/iPod_1.1.2_39A10023.ipsw)
- [iPod nano 7th generation (2012)](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iPod/SBML/osx/bundles/031-26260-201500810-D2BC269E-3FBC-11E5-885A-067B3A53DB92/iPod_1.0.4_37A40005.ipsw)
- [iPod nano 6th generation](https://secure-appldnld.apple.com/iPod/SBML/osx/bundles/041-1920.20111004.CpeEw/iPod_1.2_36B10147.ipsw)

Select your iPod in the sidebar of Finder or iTunes. Hold down the Option key (Mac) or Shift key (Windows), and click Check for Update, then choose the stock firmware you just downloaded.

Note: For iPod nano 7th generation (2012), you need to "update" from custom 1.1.2 firmware to stock 1.0.4 firmware. This is safe, you won't lose data or encounter functional issues.

#### 11) If your iPod doesn't boot at all, or shows a "Connect to iTunes" Recovery screen:
- Connect your iPod to a Windows PC or older Mac running macOS Mojave (10.14) or earlier. This also works if you use a Windows virtual machine on Linux, as long as you connect your iPod to the virtual machine.
- Open iTunes on your Windows PC or older Mac.
- For iPod nano 7th generation, press and hold both the Home button and the power button until iTunes detects it in DFU mode.
- For iPod nano 6th generation, press and hold both the volume down button and the power button until iTunes detects it in DFU mode.
- Click "Restore iPod".
- After restore completes, connect it back to your Mac.
- On macOS or Linux, double click the iPod icon on your Desktop to open it as a disk. On Windows, open File Explorer and double click your iPod.
- Delete everything on your iPod, copy your backup made in step 8 back to your iPod, then eject it from the sidebar of Finder (Mac), Files (Linux), or taskbar (Windows).
- Your iPod should spring back to life with all previous data.
